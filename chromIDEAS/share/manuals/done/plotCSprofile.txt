Description:
    This tool calculates scores per genome regions and creates a profile plot for scores over sets of genomic regions. 
Typically, the genome regions are genes, but any other regions defined in a BED file can be used. A chromatin state 
segmentation generated by chromIDEAS or ideasCS is required.

To learn more about the specific parameters, type:
$ plotCSprofile TSS -h
OR
$ plotCSprofile Body -h

Note:
       plotCSprofile TSS: In TSS mode, only those genomicpositions before (upstream) and/or after (downstream) of the TSS will be plotted.
  plotCSprofile Body: In Body mode, all regions are stretched or shrunken to the length indicated by the user.
