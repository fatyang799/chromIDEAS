Description:
    ideasCS is a Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System tool. It learns chromatin state 
models from the normalized epigenomic signals simultaneously along the genome and across cell types to improve 
consistency of state assignments across different cell types. Detail algorithms can be viewed:

Required arguments:
  Option                    Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -m <metadata>             Path to a metadata file (space-delimited) for CS segmentation, containing the Cell, Marker, 
                            Signal file info [Default: None]. Example:
                                cell1 H3K4me3 file1.bedgraph
                                cell2 H3K4me3 file2.bedgraph
                                cell1 H3K9me3 file3.bedgraph
                                cell2 H3K9me3 file4.bedgraph
                                ...
  -o <out_dir>              Output directory. [Default: ./]
  -d <id_name>              Output filename prefix. [Default: chromIDEAS]

Optional arguments:
  Option                    Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -f <otherpara>            This allows you to use .para file from previous run as priors for the Gaussian distribution 
                            parameters in the current job (Example: -f ${out_dir}/${prefix}.para). However, currently 
                            we assume that the set of marks and their orders in input are the same between previous and 
                            current data. [Default: None]
  -p <nthreads>             Number of parallel processes. [Default: 4]
  -I <impute>               Imputation for missing marker data. You can set it as "None" or "All" or the markers you 
                            want to impute. All markers to be imputed are separated by commas (e.g. "H3K4me3,H3K9me3"). 
                            [Default: None]
  -t <train>                The number of random starts used to select the state, which determines the number of times 
                            to pre-train the HMM model. The higher the value, the more stable the model is, but at the 
                            same time the computation consumes more time. [Default: 100]
  -s <trainsz>              The bin number used to pre-train model. The higher the value, the more stable the model is, 
                            but at the same time the computation consumes more time. CAUTION: <trainsz> must be less 
                            than row number of signal file specified in <metadata>. If <trainsz> exceeds file row count, 
                            it will be set to 60% of row count. [Default: 500000]
  -C <num>                  Specify number of states at the initialization stage. We recommend setting the initial number 
                            of states slightly larger than the number of states you expect or are willing to handle. 
                            [Default: 100]
  -G <num>                  Specify the number of states to be inferred. The final number of inferred states may be smaller 
                            than the number you specified. 0: let program determine. [Default: 0]
  -e <minerr>               Specify the minimum standard deviation for the emission Gaussian distribution, usually between 
                            (0,1]. [Default: 0.5]
  -B <burnin>               The number of burnins. Increasing the number will increase computing and only slightly increase 
                            accuracy. [Default: 20]
  -M <mcmc>                 The number of steps for maximization. Increasing the number will increase computing and only 
                            slightly increase accuracy. [Default: 5]
  -z                        Compress output files in gzip format. [Default: false]
  -h                        Show this help message and exit.
  -v                        Show program's version number and exit.
